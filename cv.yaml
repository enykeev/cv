summary: |
  I'm a software engineer passionate for building systems that improve daily lives of
  fellow engineers. After five years making StackStorm the best automation platform 
  on the market, I decided to take a year of career break to recharge batteries and
  catch up on a personal goals. And now I'm ready for my next journey.

  I'm looking for a company that help me further grow my set of engineering skills,
  provide me with adequate challenge and work with me on elliminating chores from our
  daily and professional lives to create space for things we truly enjoy.

  I'm primarily interested in a remote position, though the eventual relocation is on
  the table.

projects:
  - name: StackStorm
    github: https://github.com/stackstorm/
    description: |
      General purpose event-driven automation service. The core portion of the service
      handles "if this than that" kind of automation, processing events from both cloud
      and on-premise sources, making a decision based on a set of rules and workflows 
      and performing necessary actions for the purpose of automating a certain 
      user-specific domain. Most notable users include: Netflix, who uses version of the
      system to perform remediation on their ten thousands of Cassandra nodes; Dimension
      Data, that uses it to automate infrastructure in government projects and provides 
      it for their customers as a part of DiData cloud platform; Encore, that uses it in
      enterprise scale IT infrastructure for VM & server provisioning, automation, 
      network diagnosis, configuration and orchestration on customers' public and private
      clouds
    contribution: |
      Being hired at the early stage of the startup, I had to dip my toes in almost every
      part of the product. From initial customer demos and interviews, coming up with the
      idea, through several stages of prototypes, a final release, two major releases and 
      evenual aquisition. Or two.

  - name: StackStorm Web UI
    github: https://github.com/stackstorm/st2web
    description: |
      Basic user interface for StackStorm. Helps user to get introspection into inner 
      workings of the system in highier fidelity and often with better user experience 
      than basic StackStorm CLI client. Also, a very important marketing tool to help get 
      the point across.
    contribution: |
      Since day one, I've been responsible for the entirety of the product design and 
      development including build systems, several iterations of UI design, eventual 
      transition from Angular 1 to React. Periodically, I had to closely work with a 
      number of contractors filling gaps in UI and UX design and guiding us through
      changes in corporate branding strategy.

  - name: StackStorm Workflow Composer
    description: |
      WYSIWYG editor for Mistral\Orquesta workflows with live two-way binding between 
      interactable workflow graph and YAML representation of the workflow while keeping 
      code formatting and author comments intact.
    contribution: |
      Another project I've been soloely responsible for designing and implementing. One 
      of most challenging front-end projects I did to date, mostly due to high amount of 
      interactivity, complexity of visual design and data manipulation.

  - name: StackStorm Exchange
    github: https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/
    description: |
      Open package management system built exclusively on top of Github and CircleCI.
    contribution: |
      Designed and implemented a system that leverages free tiers of Github and CircleCI 
      for purpose of managing an ever-growing ecosytem of publicly available StackStorm 
      packages in a way that requires minimal amount of maintenance once set up.

  - name: OpenStack Mistral
    github: https://github.com/openstack/mistral/
    description: General purpose workflow engine.
    contribution: |
      At early stages of the startup, I've been assigned for a three month to contribute 
      into an opensource project we've planned to extensively use as a part of StackStorm 
      offering. My job was to carefully learn the inner workings of the system, establish 
      our team as an active contributer in the project and provide analytical support to 
      both our and Mistral teams to ensure Mistral's smooth transition through incubation 
      process in OpenStack community and having necessary set of features for it to be 
      useful in our work.

    description: General purpose automation service
    contribution: |
      This was my personal project after I've decided to conclude my career break. The main 
      goal was to refresh on what I've learned during my time in StackStorm and build a similar 
      service as I've imagined it over the years.
