summary: |
  I'm a software engineer passionate for building systems that improve daily lives of
  fellow engineers. I have extensive experience in frontend engineering work, but I also
  enjoy working on backends, devops, tooling and infrastructure. I've often been
  responsible for driving the entire projects by myself or in a small team, working
  across timezones and wearing many hats. 

  I'm looking for a company that help me further grow my set of engineering skills,
  provide me with adequate challenge and work with me on elliminating chores from our
  daily and professional lives to create space for things we truly enjoy.

  I'm specifically looking for a company in the Netherlands that will extend a
  sponsorship visa to me.

projects:
  - name: DataSet
    website: https://app.scalyr.com
    description: |
      DataSet (formerly, Scalyr) is a platform for storing immutable schemaless temporal
      data (primarly, logs) that allows for effective full text search on a petabyte
      scale across long retention periods.
    contribution: |
      I've been frontend engineer on this project for about three years, contributing to
      every part of the product's interface and getting an understanding of every 
      dependency and every interaction our users may perform. In terms of features, my
      biggest contributions were new Log Overview page that shows detailed information on
      the sources and types of logs user sends to his account, and the Traces page that
      visualizes tracing data coming from OpenTelemetry collectors and brings the entire
      new way to analyze your application's behaviour from a different perspective.
      But the most impactful contributions of mine were in CI, E2E and monitoring where
      I spent countless hours fixing flaky tests, Jenkins pipeline issues and finding
      ways to improve our internal application metric and interaction logging to aid
      decision-making and incident response processes.

      An internal project build around automating routine business tasks such as billing,
      invoicing, provisioning new customers and general record-keeping.
    contribution: |
      I have been tasked to automate the decade old semi-manual process of billing
      hundreds of customers that involved interaction between half a dozen of stakeholders
      across the company at the start of every month. I had to learn the process from the
      ground up, interviewing every person and gathering every script involved, simplify
      the process by removing unncessary steps, reducing number of manual interventions
      required, restructuring the data and tooling to centralize the process inside one
      service and adding safeguards to reduce a chance of human error. I've built the
      service that continuously ingests product consumption metrics alongside self-serve
      changes customers do through the product UI, created an interface on top that allowed
      newly formed Provisioning team to start creating new sales led and channel customers
      using straightforward centralized process, implemented billing support for new
      features (long term retention) and new contract types (consumption model). I also
      took over the responsibility of charging credit cards and sending email invoices.
      While the process is still not entirely automated, it is now fully codified and takes
      a fraction of the time and effort required.

      General purpose event-driven automation service. The core portion of the service
      handles "if this than that" kind of automation, processing events from both cloud
      and on-premise sources, making a decision based on a set of rules and workflows 
      and performing necessary actions for the purpose of automating a certain 
      user-specific domain. Most notable users include: Netflix, who uses version of the
      system to perform remediation on their ten thousands of Cassandra nodes; Dimension
      Data, that uses it to automate infrastructure in government projects and provides 
      it for their customers as a part of DiData cloud platform; Encore, that uses it in
      enterprise scale IT infrastructure for VM & server provisioning, automation, 
      network diagnosis, configuration and orchestration on customers' public and private
      clouds
    contribution: |
      Being hired at the early stage of the startup, I had to dip my toes in almost every
      part of the product. From initial customer demos and interviews, coming up with the
      idea, through several stages of prototypes, a final release, two major releases and 
      evenual aquisition. Or two.
      Since day one, I've been responsible for the entirety of the product's UI
      development including build systems, several iterations of UI design, eventual 
      transition from Angular 1 to React. Periodically, I had to closely work with a 
      number of contractors filling gaps in UI and UX design and guiding us through
      changes in corporate branding strategy.

      WYSIWYG editor for Mistral\Orquesta workflows with live two-way binding between 
      interactable workflow graph and YAML representation of the workflow while keeping 
      code formatting and author comments intact.
    contribution: |
      Another project I've been soloely responsible for designing and implementing. One 
      of most challenging front-end projects I did to date, mostly due to high amount of 
      interactivity, complexity of visual design and data manipulation.

      Open package management system built exclusively on top of Github and CircleCI.
    contribution: |
      Designed and implemented a system that leverages free tiers of Github and CircleCI 
      for purpose of managing an ever-growing ecosytem of publicly available StackStorm 
      packages in a way that requires minimal amount of maintenance once set up.

    description: General purpose workflow engine.
    contribution: |
      At early stages of the startup, I've been assigned for three month to contribute 
      into an opensource project we've planned to extensively use as a part of StackStorm 
      offering. My job was to carefully learn the inner workings of the system, establish 
      our team as an active contributer in the project and provide analytical support to 
      both our and Mistral teams to ensure Mistral's smooth transition through incubation 
      process in OpenStack community and having necessary set of features for it to be 
      useful in our work.

    description: General purpose automation service
    contribution: |
      This was my personal project after I've decided to conclude my career break. The main 
      goal was to refresh on what I've learned during my time in StackStorm and build a similar 
      service as I've imagined it over the years.
