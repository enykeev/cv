summary: |
  I'm a software engineer passionate for building systems that improve daily lives of fellow engineers.
  After five years making StackStorm the best automation platform on the market, I decided to take a 
  year of career break to recharge batteries and catch up on a personal goals. And now I'm ready for my
  next journey.
  
  I'm looking for a company that help me further grow my set of engineering skills, provide me with adequate
  challenge and work with me on elliminating chores from our daily and professional lives to create space for
  things we truly enjoy.

  I'm primarily interested in a remote position with the potential of eventual relocation.

projects:
  - name: StackStorm
    github: https://github.com/stackstorm/
    description: |
      General purpose event-driven automation service. The core portion of the service handles "if this than that"
      kind of automation, processing events from both cloud and on-premise sources, making a decision based on a set
      of rules and workflows and performing necessary actions for the purpose of automating a certain user-specific
      domain. Most notable users include: Netflix, who uses version of the system to perform remediation on their ten
      thousands of Cassandra nodes; Dimension Data, that uses it to automate infrastructure in government projects and
      provides it for their customers as a part of DiData cloud platform; Encore, that uses it in enterprise scale IT
      infrastructure for VM & server provisioning, automation, network diagnosis, configuration and orchestration on 
      customers' public and private clouds
    contribution: |
      Being hired at the early stage of the startup, I had to dip my toes in almost every part of the product.
      From initial customer demos and interviews, coming up with the idea, through several stages of prototypes,
      a final release, two major releases and evenual aquisition. Or two.

  - name: StackStorm Web UI
    github: https://github.com/stackstorm/st2web
    description: |
      Basic user interface for StackStorm. Helps user to get introspection into inner workings of the system in
      highier fidelity and often with better user experience than basic StackStorm CLI client. Also, a very important
      marketing tool to help get the point across.
    contribution: |
      Since day one, I've been responsible for the entirety of the product design and development including
      build systems, several iterations of UI design, eventual transition from Angular 1 to React. Periodically,
      I had to closely work with a number of contractors filling gaps in UI and UX design and guiding us through
      changes in corporate branding strategy.

  - name: StackStorm Workflow Composer
    description: |
      WYSIWYG editor for Mistral\Orquesta workflows with live two-way binding between interactable workflow graph 
      and YAML representation of the workflow while keeping code formatting and author comments intact.
    contribution: |
      Another project I've been soloely responsible for designing and implementing. One of most challenging front-end
      projects I did to date, mostly due to high amount of interactivity, complexity of visual design and data
      manipulation.

  - name: StackStorm Exchange
    github: https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/
    description: Open package management system built exclusively on top of Github and CircleCI.
    contribution: |
      Designed and implemented a system that leverages free tiers of Github and CircleCI for purpose of managing an
      ever-growing ecosytem of publicly available StackStorm packages in a way that requires minimal amount of
      maintenance once set up.

  - name: OpenStack Mistral
    github: https://github.com/openstack/mistral/
    description: General purpose workflow engine.
    contribution: |
      At early stages of the startup, I've been assigned for a three month to contribute into an opensource project
      we've planned to extensively use as a part of StackStorm offering. My job was to carefully learn the inner 
      workings of the system, establish our team as an active contributer in the project and provide analytical
      support to both our and Mistral teams to ensure Mistral's smooth transition through incubation process in 
      OpenStack community and having necessary set of features for it to be useful in our work.
